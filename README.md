## Lets talk Water
Water makes a huge difference in espresso taste and itâ€™s a factor in why you may have a different experience from one setup to another. 

For the majority of the year, I used a BWT Penguin 2.7L Water Pitcher with OEM 1 Magnesium Mineralizing Filters [https://www.wholelattelove.com/products/bwt-penguin-2-7-l-water-pitcher].

During the end of the Olympia: Yabitu Koba Natural I switched to Lotus Water [https://lotuscoffeeproducts.com/]. Lotus water is a way to play with the minerals in your water and allow you to achieve different flavors depending on which minerals you use and how much. For this method, I use distilled water and then add the Lotus minerals to it. This adds an additional layer to achieving the same results as I have. What I will add here is what I believe is the best combination of minerals and possibly if it makes sense an interesting combination.

### Lotus Water Recipes
